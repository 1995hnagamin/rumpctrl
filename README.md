[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rumpkernel/rumprun-posix.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rumpkernel/rumprun-posix)

Rumpctrl provides configuration, control and diagnostic utilities for
rump kernels.  These utilities can be run on a POSIX-type
userspace platform to remotely inspect and adjust the status of rump
kernels via the _sysproxy_ remote system call facility.  This repository
provides both the build framework and a selection of familiar utilities
such as `ifconfig`, `mount`, `sysctl`, and more.

See [the wiki](http://wiki.rumpkernel.org/Repo:-rumpctrl) for more
information and instructions.
